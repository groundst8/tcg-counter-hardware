- 7 Segment E-Paper Display
- +/- 1.5V operating voltage
- 0.81 uA steady state current, all segments on
- 2.92 mA peak current (all segments?) 417uA / segment?

## v2 Design Tradeoffs

The v1 hardware will only interface to a single 7 segment display. Representing 1-9 counters is useful and a good proof of concept for getting hardware working. I think the value would be improved significantly by adding a second 7 segment display to be able to represent counter values from 1-99. While a single chip solution is possible for driving a single 7 segment display, driving two will require some additional chips because as far as I am aware the most GPIOs on an integrated MCU NFC chip is 12. 

Options:
- 2:1 (SPDT) 8-Channel Switch, would have to tie common electrode to ground (slower off switching) due to limited gpios and one needed to select between displays
- 16 Channel Demultiplexer, each segment addressable with 4 GPIOs, 1 for value (on/off), one for common electrode (on/off)
- I2C GPIO Expander (TCAL9539)
- NFC I2C to general MCU with > 14 GPIOs

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Given parameters
I_peak = (2.92/7)*1000        # Peak current in uA
I_steady = (0.00081/7)*1000   # Steady-state current in uA
taus = [40, 50, 60]           # Different time constants in ms

# Time array from 0 to 300 ms
t = np.linspace(0, 300, 1000)  # Time in ms

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Plotting the decay function for each time constant
for tau in taus:
    I_t = I_steady + (I_peak - I_steady) * np.exp(-t / tau)
    plt.plot(t, I_t, label=f'Ï„ = {tau} ms')

plt.title('Current Decay During Electrochromic Display Switching')
plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
plt.ylabel('Current (uA)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
